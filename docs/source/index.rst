Fast Equilibration of Ocean Tracers Software
============================================

About
*****
FEOTS is a platform that aids in diagnosing and applying ocean transport and vertical mixing operators from the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) to run offline transient or equilibration simulations of passive tracer systems. 

FEOTS helps facilitate the reuse of climate model data by creating databases of sparse matrices that represent ocean advection and diffusion proceses captured from state-of-the-art climate simulations. These transport operator databases and FEOTS allow oceanographers to develop physical, chemical, and biological ocean models that incorporate validated climate model transport operators at a fraction of the computational expense.
